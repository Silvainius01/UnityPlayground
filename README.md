# UnityPlayground

This project contains a collection of various projects I work on sometimes.
If they get big enough, I move them to their own repos, as with NeuralNetPlayground, which was first and only project in my original playground project space. 

Currently, the projects contained within are as follows:
 - GrunkaMunkaLibrary (GML), a set of useful scripts and calsses developed and maintaned by [Matthew VanCompernolle](https://github.com/mvancompernolle/) and I. It has no hosting repo (yet)
 - A Settlers of Catan implementation, which is awaiting porting from a C# console app to here.
 - A an entire folder(!) structured to contain an FPS, which I may or may not ever get around to making.
